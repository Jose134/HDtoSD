osu! hd skin to sd converter

This program will convert all the "@2x" files in your skin folder to SD resolution files. It takes the "@2x" images and resizes them to half their size, generating a SD resolution version file in the same folder.

##NOTE:
The program must be in the skin folder in order for it to find the images
